# Mathematica-Algebra-Calculations
Theoretical Physics Mathematica 
The purpose of this code is that: I want to use mathematica to realize some algebras. Usually, if we want to expectation in shm setting, we use
the creation/annhiliation operators. But it is hard to create these abstract operators rather matrix representation for these operators.
So in this code, I create this abstract operators which can be used to compute the expectation values in few seconds.

Also if one wishs, one can construct any lie algebra (lorentz algebra, spin algebra, poincare algebra, susy algebra if they want via this code template.)
