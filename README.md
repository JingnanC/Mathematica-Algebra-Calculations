Theoretical Physics Mathematica 
The purpose of this code is that: I want to use mathematica to realize some algebras. Usually, if we want to expectation in shm setting, we use
the creation/annhiliation operators. But it is hard to create these abstract operators rather matrix representation for these operators.
So in this code, I create this abstract operators which can be used to compute the expectation values in few seconds.
